# liftingpal
Logging app for your workouts


The goal behind this project is to create a weightlifting logger with flexible views on historical numbers, graphs on progress, and overall an in-depth view into how much a user lifts, and over what time. It can be found [here](https://cryptic-beach-97775.herokuapp.com/).

As of August 2017 it is in the icebox while I am learning PHP and mySQL.
